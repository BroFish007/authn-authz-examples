# Authentication and Authorization Examples

## Overview/Purpose

This repository contains coding examples to show how modern authentication (authN) and authorization (authZ) techniques can be implemented.

There are multiple front-end options that can interact with any of the multiple back-end options. Choose only one of each.
While they are swappable, they implement things subtly differently.
The READMEs in each directory will help you choose the one you want.

## Software Installation

### Node on CentOS 7
Do not install nodejs via `yum install npm` because the version is too old.
