# Front End Option 1

This is a REACT front end that call Auth0 for authentication and authorization.

To run, simply do 3 things:
 1. Execute: `set HTTPS=true&&npm start`
 2. Accept the cert in the "Your connection is not private" warning
 3. Go to the URL https://ui.localtest.me:3000/ (which resolves to 127.0.0.1). This is a very important step.

This directory was originally created with "npm create-react-app...",
and README_orig.md is the resulting auto-generated README.
